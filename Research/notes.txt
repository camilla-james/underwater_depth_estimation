MDE:
- Monocular Depth Estimation is the task of estimating the depth value (distance relative to the camera) of each pixel given a single (monocular) RGB image. This challenging task is a key prerequisite for determining scene understanding for applications such as 3D scene reconstruction, autonomous driving, and AR. State-of-the-art methods usually fall into one of two categories: designing a complex network that is powerful enough to directly regress the depth map, or splitting the input into bins or windows to reduce computational complexity.
  
- Models are typically evaluated using RMSE or absolute relative error.
