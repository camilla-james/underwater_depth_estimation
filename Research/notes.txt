MDE:
- Monocular Depth Estimation is the task of estimating the depth value (distance relative to the camera) of each pixel given a single (monocular) RGB image. This challenging task is a key prerequisite for determining scene understanding for applications such as 3D scene reconstruction, autonomous driving, and AR. State-of-the-art methods usually fall into one of two categories: designing a complex network that is powerful enough to directly regress the depth map, or splitting the input into bins or windows to reduce computational complexity.
  
- Models are typically evaluated using RMSE or absolute relative error.

Observations
- ground truths -> weirdly uncompatible:
  - imprecise algorithms 
  - flesea: objects in the water, not considered for the depth, missing things that depthAnything sees
- average absRel, good RMSE, bad delta
- delta could be a result of the scale
- labels are metric, depthAnything is not 
- conclusion: evaluating depthAnything on labelled data is not going to give a good performance
  - despite scaling and flipping
